Notetrap
========

Notetrap is a simple command line note taking application implemented 
as a shell script. Each note entered on the command line is appended 
with a date, time, current timetrap timesheet (`t now`), and filed away 
into the daily note file. The script also contains some utility 
functions to `list`, `edit`, and `search` through the notefiles.

All the note files are stored in the /usr/notes directory unless 
otherwise modified. 

This is the result of inspiration drawn largely from Lifehacker posts 
about managing life through text files. It's name is a 
nod to timetrap http://github.com/samg/timetrap by samg.
